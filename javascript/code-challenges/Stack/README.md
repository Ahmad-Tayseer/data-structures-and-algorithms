# Stack.
This code challenge about how to deal with the basics of stacks.
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge
We should create push, pop, peek and isEmpty methods in the class of queue.
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

## Approach & Efficiency
- push function: Time: O(1) space: O(1).
- pop function: Time: O(1) space: O(1).
- peek function: Time: O(1) space: O(1).
- isEmpty function: Time: O(1) space: O(1).
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

## API
- push function: add a new node to the rear of stack.
- pop function: remove a node from the front of stack.
- peek function: return the value of the front node of stack.
- isEmpty function: checking if the stack have nodes or not then return a boolean.
