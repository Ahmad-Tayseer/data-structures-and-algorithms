# Queue.
This code challenge about how to deal with the basics of queues.
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge
We should create enqueue, dequeue, peek and isEmpty methods in the class of queue.
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

## Approach & Efficiency
- enqueue function: Time: O(1) space: O(1).
- dequeue function: Time: O(1) space: O(1).
- peek function: Time: O(1) space: O(1).
- isEmpty function: Time: O(1) space: O(1).
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

## API
- enqueue function: add a new node to the rear of queue.
- dequeue function: remove a node from the front of queue.
- peek function: return the value of the front node of queue.
- isEmpty function: checking if the queue have nodes or not then return a boolean.
