# Singly Linked List
This code challenge about how to deal with the basics of single linked lists.
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge
We should create a linked list class, then create some function inside the class which are: insert, include and toString functions where I can insert a new node, check if a given value exists in the nodes found in the linked list, and return a string of the values exist at the all nodes inside the linked list.
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

## Approach & Efficiency
append function: Time: O(n) space: O(1).
insert function: Time: O(1) space: O(1).
include function: Time: O(n) space: O(1).
toString function: Time: O(n) space: O(1).
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

## API
append function: add a new node to the tail of the linked list.
insert function: insert a new node in the head of the linked list.
include function: check the given value if it is exists at the value of nodes found inside the linked list.
toString function: return a string have all the values exist at all nodes inside the linked list.

# Linked List Insertions
This code challenge about how to deal with the basics of single linked lists.
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge
We should create append, insert before and insert after functions in the class of linked list.
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

## Approach & Efficiency
append function: Time: O(n) space: O(1).
inserBefore function: Time: O(n) space: O(1).
insertAfter function: Time: O(n) space: O(1).
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

## API
append function: add a new node to the tail of the linked list.
inserBefore function: insert a new node before the node that have a value equals to the value given in the arguments.
insertAfter function: insert a new node after the node that have a value equals to the value given in the arguments.

# k-th value from the end of a linked list.
This code challenge about how to deal with the basics of single linked lists.
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge
We should create kthFromEnd function in the class of linked list.
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

## Approach & Efficiency
kthFromEnd function: Time: O(n) space: O(1).
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

## API
kthFromEnd function: return the nodeâ€™s value that is k places from the tail of the linked list.

# Zip two linked lists.
This code challenge about how to deal with the basics of single linked lists.
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge
We should create zipLists function in the class of linked list.
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

## Approach & Efficiency
zipLists function: Time: O(n) space: O(1).
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

## API
zipLists function: zip the two linked lists given as an arguments together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the the zipped list.
